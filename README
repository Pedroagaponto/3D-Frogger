This code was implemented as part of COSC1186/1187 Interactive 3D Graphics and
Animation course.

Features:
	-Draws a sphere to represent a frog using parametric equations.
	-Draws a parabola representing the 3D jump tragetory using parametric
	equations.
	-Controls the x and z direction of the frog(ie, rotation around the y axis).
	-Controls the speed/rotation of the frogâ€™s jump.
	-Animates the frog using the numerical integration technique in three
	dimensions.
	-Uses a third person perspective camera, that follows the frog as it moves.
	-Draws a simple world (a grid 100x100 on the xz plane).
	-Draws moving cylinders to represent logs, and moving cubes to represent
	cars.
	-Draws normal vectors for all geometry being rendered and tangents for the
	parabola.
	-Applies lighting to all geometry.
	-Adds keyboard controls for for toggling lighting/wifreframe mode.

Extra features:
	-Changes parabola color to red when the tragetory is too long, showing
	that the frog cannot land more than 10 units far from the initial position.
	-Changes parabola color to red when the tragetory is landing outside the
	grid, showing that the frog cannot land if there is no "floor".
	-Allows to switch on/off the debug (verbose) mode during program execution.
	-Uses cubes and cylinders to draw a figure more like a real car than just a
	cube.

Controls:
	-'v': toggle debug mode
	-'o': toggle axes
	-'n': toggle normals and the parabola tangent
	-'p': toggle wireframe
	-'l': toggle lightining.
	-'w': increase speed
	-'s': decrease speed
	-'a': increase angle
	-'d': decrease angle
	-' ': jump
	-left mouse: rotate camera
	-left arrow: rotate frog left
	-right mouse: zoom camera
	-right arrow: rotate frog right
	-'q' or 'Q' or ESC: exit program

How to compile:
	-In the project folder, use the command 'make'

How to use:
	-In the project folder, use the command './frogger'

Observation:
	This project was made using Git. The git files are included in the
	project folder.
