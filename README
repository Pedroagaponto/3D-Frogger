This code was implemented as part of COSC1186/1187 Interactive 3D Graphics and
Animation course.

Features:
	-Draws a circle to represent a frog using both cartesian and parametric
	equations
	-Draws normal and tangent vectors for the circle
	-Draws a vector representing the angle and speed of the circle (frog)
	when it jumps.
	-Draws a parabola representing the path of the circle (frog) when it jumps,
	using both cartesian and parametric equations.
	-Draws normal and tangent vectors for the parabola.
	-Animates the circle (frog) to use projectile motion when the frog,
	following the path of the parabola.
	-Calculates the position of the circle (frog) both analytically,
	and by integrating the acceleration/velocity.
	-Draws x/y axes.

Extra features:
	-Changes parabola color to red when it ends outside the window, showing
	that the frog cannot land there.
	-Allows to switch on/off the debug (verbose) mode during program execution

Controls:
	-'v' or 'V': toggle verbose mode on/off
	-‘w’ or 'W': increase speed
	-’s’ or 'S': decrease speed
	-‘a’ or 'A': increase angle
	-‘d’ or 'D': decrease angle
	-‘t’ or 'T': toggle tangent visualisation
	-‘n’ or 'N': toggle normal visualisation
	-‘f’ or 'F': toggle between cartesian/parametric equations
	-‘i’ or 'I': toggle between analytical and numerical integration
	-'q' or 'Q' or ESC: exit program
	-up arrow: double number of segments
	-down arrow: halve number of segments
	-spacebar: jump

How to compile:
	-In the project folder, use the command 'make'

How to use:
	-In the project folder, use the command './frogger'

Observation:
	This project was versionated using Git. The git files are included in the
	project folder.
